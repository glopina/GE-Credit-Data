# GE-Credit-Data
Final Capstone Project, logistic regression for default on credit loans. 
"""The dataset contains 31 variables and the target variable is DEFAULT. Most variables are categorical with the exception of duration, amount, installment rate, age, number of credits and number of dependents. Several variables were ignored for ethical reasons: male divorced, male single, male married widowed, age, job (which is type of job) and foreign. These could possibly lead to discriminatory lending practices. The model has 10 significant variables (duration, install_rate, chk_account, history, new_car, used_car, sav_acct, guarantor, Present_resident, and other_installment). Oddly, the amount of the loan was not as significant but I chose to leave it in the final model. An important variable that is not included in this dataset was the salary of the applicant."""
